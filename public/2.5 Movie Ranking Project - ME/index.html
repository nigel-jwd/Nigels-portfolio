<h1>The Best Movies According To Nigel</h1>
<h2>The Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Mystery Of Aaravos</h3>
<p>I love this anime, it has alot of compassion, fear, mistory & drama. <br> Making me as the watcher feels apart of it.</p>
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>When it comes to adventure, one piece is one of my top favourites. <br> with  7 brave heros, with different ideals in life, different 
    goals. As they travel the same path, facing challenges every step of the way together.
